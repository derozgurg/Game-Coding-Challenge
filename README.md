#### Study Case

I spent about 24 hours for this project. At the beginning creating project structure kept me long. 
I had a hard time developing a game state management system from scratch.  
Another problem I had was the algorithm of purchasing a business upgrade. I spent a deal of time to analyze that algorithm. To be honest I don't really know whether it is correct. 


What I would do when I have enough time.

1. I would study on state management and try to make it more optimize. 
2. I would create a tutorial engine
3. I would create reusable ui components which are in tune for the game's interactions like alert or confirm box.
